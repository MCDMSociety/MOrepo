A special case is, for instance, a bi-objective version of the (vertex) p-centdian problem. We show that bi-objective facility location problems of this type can be solved efficiently by means of an epsilon-constraint method that solves at most (n-1)m minisum problems, where n is the number of customer points and m the number of potential facility sites. Additionally, we compare the approach to a lexicographic epsilon-constrained method that only returns efficient solutions and to a two-phase method relying on the perpendicular search method. We report extensive computational results obtained from several classes of facility location problems. The proposed algorithm compares very favorably to both the lexicographic epsilon-constrained method and to the two phase method.},\n  doi      = {10.1007/s10479-016-2360-8},\n}\n\n"

When increasing the number of objective functions, however, the polyhedral structure of the linear relaxation becomes more complex, and consequently requires more computational effort to obtain. In this paper we overcome this obstacle by speeding up the computations. To do so, in each branching node we use information available from its farther node to warm-start a Bensons-like algorithm. We show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the CPU time of the framework on several different problem classes with three, four and five objective functions. Moreover, we point out difficulties that arise when non-binary integer variables are introduced in the models, and test our algorithm on problem that contains non-binary integer variables too.},\n  journal     = {Optimization Online},\n  keywords    = {forget21a.pdf},\n  url         = {http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_HTML/2021/08/8531.html},\n}"
