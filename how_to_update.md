# Notes for admin

To update MOrepo with a new contribution do

   1) Check the new contribution using `MOrepoTools::checkContribution()`.
   2) Add the contribution to the json file `contributions.json`.
   3) If a contribution has changed then modify `contributions.json`, e.g. with a space.
   4) Push to GitHub and GitHub actions should do the rest.
